Hello there,

This is a compilation of all the exercises and examples reviewed in the book "Grokking Algorithms".
The goal of this exercise is to refresh the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms.
For this exercise I used Python, however the logic is the same in any language.

Feel free to use and customize these examples, the purpose is simply to practice the logic of the code and to know where each algorithm best fits, either because of the time it takes or the problem it solves.

Have fun with it.
Angel,
